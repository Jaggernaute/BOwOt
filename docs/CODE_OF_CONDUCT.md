# Code of Conduct

Everyone that interacts with the PowaBonk project is expected to follow those   
guidelines:
1. Use the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system and a unix makefile to execute all commands.
2. Use the Ninja compiler.
3. Follow the LLVM cpp [style guide](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html).
4. Try to avoid CLang tidy warnings (some rules contradicts each others so try to   
   avoid them but use some common sense).
5. use c++23 or higher(when it'll be released).


And in general, everyone is expected to be **open**,  
**considerate**, and **respectful** of others no matter what their position is  
within the project.
